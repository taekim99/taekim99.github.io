      <h2>Sortify</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        The Sortify is a Python script designed to automate the organization of files within a specified
        directory. The main goal is to categorize files into different folders based on their types, providing a
        systematic approach to managing and accessing your files. Whether you have documents, presentations, music,
        images, videos, or other file types, the File Organizer ensures a structured and tidy file system.
      </p>
      <br />
      <div>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Automatic Categorization:</strong> The script automatically categorizes files based on their
            extensions into predefined folders, such as documents, presentations, music, images, and videos.</li>
          <br />
          <li><strong>Customizable File Types:</strong> Customize the script to recognize and organize specific file
            types according to your needs. Easily extend the list of supported file extensions.</li>
          <br />
          <li><strong>Directory Handling:</strong> The script handles not only individual files but also entire
            directories. If it encounters a directory, it organizes the directory itself into a specified "unknown"
            folder or another appropriate category.</li>
          <br />
          <li><strong>Avoids Duplicates:</strong> The script checks for existing files in the destination folders to
            avoid duplicates. If a file already exists, it skips the move operation and notifies you.</li>
